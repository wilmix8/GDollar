# GDollar
===========

 GDOLLAR Programming Language  is a modern Programming Language consists of JAVA OOPS, Behave like C/C++ OOPS, Networking, RUN and compile at same time,used in Software Developement  , Research, and ,Advanced OOPs. It is used in case of  constructing  datastructures,etc.
 
 GDollar  is   invented   in  C/C++, JAVA , and , C#.

How GDOLLAR P.L Works?
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-
At  first  .gdollar  is compiled by GDOLLARc compiler

After that GDOLLARc  convert to  bytecode (class files )and  it  use
GDOLLAR-JAVA Runtime   to run the Program.


GDOLLAR ADvantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) GDOLLAR is the combination of JAVA , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.
b) GDOLLAR will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.
c) GDOLLAR also used for construction of any datastructures.
d) GDOLLAR helps the developers to provide inheritance by not using extends
keyword
and call the class in main program when use in linux.
e) GDOLLAR Solves diamond Problem with multiple Inheritance when used in linux.
f) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.
g) GDOLLAR support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.
h) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.
i) GDOLLAR is a High level language.
j) GDOLLAR is highly portable language
k) Using GDOLLAR you can create any datastructures as libraries and
use it in your Application program.
l) GDOLLAR language is a structured and object programming language.
m) GDOLLAR has OOPS concepts like JAVA.
n) GDOLLAR have the concept of Packages,etc.
o) GDOLLAR have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.
p) It Support functions with Default Arguments
q) It Supports Exception handling
r) It Support Generic Programming
s) It have pointer and Nodes..
t) GDOLLAR is much simpler oops concepts, which leads to faster development and less mental
overhead.
u) GDOLLAR is almost always explicitly compiled
w) GDOLLAR is easy to learn. GDOLLAR was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,
compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
GDOLLAR is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
GDOLLAR is platform-independent.
x) GDOLLAR creates   .exe  or  .dll   files   and  it  can be  used  with   GDOLLAR  main  program   (CWE  EDitor  )   to  create  a  complete  software.
y) GDOLLAR will compile and run at same time where other technology can't
do
z) GDOLLAR is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the
goods,Graphics,etc
AA) GDOLLAR is platform independant language
BB) GDOLLAR is an interactive Technology.
CC) GDOLLAR  is   used  only  in  companies  and  industries.
DD)  GDollar  is used   in  compiler design  and  datastructures construction.
